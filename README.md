# Score-Ghost
Proxy for archiving E-amusement scores while playing.

This proxy saves confirmed save requests and has the option to also save any request where the method contains the word: "save"

This proxy does not feature ARC4 Decryption, LZ77 Decompression etc. If you are more interrested into that then here's my E-amusement decryption library: <a href="Destroy"</a>
