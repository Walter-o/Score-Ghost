This proxy saves confirmed save requests and has the option to also save any request where the method contains the word: "save"

This proxy does not feature ARC4 Decryption, LZ77 Decompression etc. If you are more interrested into that then here's my E-amusement decryption library: <a href="https://github.com/Walter-o/Destroy">Destroy</a>
